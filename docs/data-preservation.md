# Data Preservation During Plan Changes

This document outlines how user data is preserved during subscription plan changes (upgrades and downgrades) in our application.

## Overview

When users change their subscription plan (either upgrading from free to paid or downgrading from paid to free), it's critical that their data remains intact. This includes:

- Conversation history
- User preferences and settings
- Account information
- Custom configurations

Our implementation ensures that only subscription-specific fields are modified during plan changes, while all other user data is preserved.

## Implementation Details

### Database Operations

When modifying a user's subscription status, we follow these principles:

1. **Selective Updates**: Only update the specific fields related to subscription status (`paid`, `paypalSubscriptionId`)
2. **Explicit Field Selection**: Explicitly select which fields to update rather than overwriting the entire user record
3. **Data Verification**: Verify the user exists before making changes
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to prevent data loss during failed operations

### Upgrade Process (Free → Paid)

During an upgrade:

1. First fetch the current user data to ensure we have the latest state
2. Only update the subscription-specific fields:
   - `paid` = '1'
   - `paypalSubscriptionId` = [new subscription ID]
3. Preserve all other user data including conversation history and preferences
4. Maintain usage tracking data for continuity

### Downgrade Process (Paid → Free)

During a downgrade:

1. First fetch the current user data to ensure we have the latest state
2. Only update the subscription-specific fields:
   - `paid` = null
   - `paypalSubscriptionId` = null
3. Reset usage counters to start fresh on the free plan:
   - `dailyConversationCount` = 0
   - `lastConversationDate` = [current date]
4. Preserve all other user data including conversation history and preferences

## User Experience

Users are informed about data preservation during plan changes through:

1. **Plan Change Notifications**: Displayed after successful plan changes
2. **Documentation**: Available in help resources and during the upgrade/downgrade process
3. **Confirmation Messages**: Clear messaging during the plan change process

## Testing

We verify data preservation through:

1. **Automated Tests**: Unit and integration tests that verify data integrity during plan changes
2. **Manual Testing**: Regular verification of the upgrade/downgrade flow
3. **Data Audits**: Periodic checks to ensure no data loss has occurred during plan changes

## Safeguards

Additional safeguards to prevent data loss:

1. **Transaction-based Updates**: Database operations use transactions where appropriate
2. **Retry Mechanisms**: Failed operations can be retried with the `withRetry` utility
3. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all plan change operations
4. **Validation**: Input validation before any database operations

## Conclusion

Our implementation ensures that users can change their subscription plans with confidence, knowing that their data will be preserved throughout the process. This approach maintains a seamless user experience while protecting valuable user data.
