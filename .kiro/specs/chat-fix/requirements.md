# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue with the AI chat functionality where messages are being sent but responses show "Unknown test prompt!" instead of actual AI responses. The problem appears to be related to the integration between the subscription system and the chat functionality, particularly after the recent changes to the subscription plans feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages in the chat and receive proper AI responses, so that I can have meaningful conversations with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message in the chat THEN the system SHALL process it correctly and return a proper AI response
2. WHEN a free user has remaining conversations THEN the system SHALL allow them to start new conversations
3. WHEN a paid user sends a message THEN the system SHALL always process it without usage limitations
4. WHEN the chat system encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the subscription system correctly integrates with the chat functionality, so that usage limits are properly enforced without breaking the core chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the subscription service checks if a user can start a conversation THEN the system SHALL return the correct result based on their plan and usage
2. WHEN the chat API receives a request THEN the system SHALL correctly check the user's subscription status before processing
3. WHEN the usage middleware runs THEN the system SHALL correctly integrate with the chat API route
4. WHEN the subscription status changes THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect this in the chat functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my current subscription status and remaining conversations in the chat interface, so that I can manage my usage effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a free user views the chat interface THEN the system SHALL display their remaining daily conversations accurately
2. WHEN a user reaches their conversation limit THEN the system SHALL show a clear upgrade prompt
3. WHEN a paid user views the chat interface THEN the system SHALL indicate they have unlimited conversations
4. WHEN the subscription status API is called THEN the system SHALL return accurate information about the user's plan and usage
